# Simple Angular i18n
This is an Angular i18n example doing the translations through _angular pipes_.

## Installation
### Install npm packages
Install the npm packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:
```shell
npm install
```
### Initialize the application
The `npm start` command first compiles the application, then simultaneously re-compiles and runs the `lite-server`. Both the compiler and the server watch for file changes.
```shell
npm start
```
You can shut the server down manually with `Ctrl-C`.
